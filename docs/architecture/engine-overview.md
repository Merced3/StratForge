# Engine Overview (Planned)

*Placeholder stub — to be filled when engine work begins.*

## Scope (planned)

- Engine loop and state machine for strategy execution.
- Shared state interactions (prices, candles, objects).
- Signal ingestion and ordering of strategy callbacks.
- Error handling and recovery hooks.

## Next steps

- Define interfaces for strategies (init/on_candle/on_close).
- Outline event flow and timing guarantees.
- Add diagrams for data/state transitions once implemented.
