# Orders & Tracking (Planned)

*Placeholder stub — to be filled when order lifecycle work begins.*

## Scope (planned)

- Order lifecycle: submission -> broker API -> fills -> P&L updates.
- Multi-buy-in/multi-entry handling and position aggregation.
- Shared state and logging for active orders.
- Error handling, retries, and reconciliation.

## Next steps

- Define order/position data model and in-memory/shared-state shape.
- Map how fills update P&L, stop loss, and position sizing.
- Add sequence diagrams for order submission and fill handling once implemented.
