# Legacy Options v1

This folder keeps the original options order flow for reference only.
These scripts are not used by the current system and are not maintained.

Why it is here:

- Preserve earlier logic while the new options subsystem is built out.
- Make it easy to compare or copy snippets if needed.

Do not import or run these files in the current codebase.
The active implementation lives under `options/` (quote hub, selection, execution).
