Day 3, the fixes from yestarday already seem to be paying off, the flagging worked today, I have no idea why some days it would and some it wouldn't, but today was pretty volitile but clean data was recorded. Day 4, good data BUT I noticed that the zones for the 15 min chart were off by one candle, what i mean was the lines, they were at the correct levels but the display of them was one off, it doesn't make teh program wrong, just my OCD kicks in, i removed one candle that I thought was the culprit, that didn't work, I added that candle back (ctrl-z), I go into more detial in the message ID.

Day 2, now this flagging issue I thought was caused by the wrong first candle but it might be another issue, cause the first candle was incorrect, the bull flags are not working but the bear flags are, other than that it was good data collection today. Day 3, no run because of implementation of new multi-visual setup with plotly instead of our previous tkinter, plus a bunch of error's when dealing with the new multi-EMA setup, trying to fix that so we can have something running tomorrow, finished majority of UI for the charts (live and static charts) so that should be cool to see tomorrow (its 1AM right now and the other past night I went to bed at 4-5AM working on this). Day 4, today i was trying to get the live chart down by making a new backend frontend websocket server connection because chatgpt recommened it, the live chart looks alot better but still were having trouble updating the chart on the browser, were getting updates via the saved PNG files but not on the browser. Day 5, this week was mainly focused on getting the new vision portion of the algo setup, adding 4 points of view for the market 1 historical and 3 live charts, todays i was fixing up the live chartting, its mostly working but could use some tweeks, overal this week was a huge improvement to the programs architecture.",

Day 2, ema data calculation after 15 min was incorrect, all the live charts (15m, 5m, 2m) ema calculations were incorrect, after the first 15 minutes it was some incorrect organization of the candle list or doubling it in the calculation, im still figuring it out but other than that, today was good. Day 3, worked on some of the `ema_manager.py` functionality because of ema calculation errors from current and previous days, hopefully the changes will work for tomorrows run, other than that today run was the same as yestardays, good. Day 4, the emas have been fixed, the fast and RESPONSIVE charts for the frontend have been fixed, the only issue were having is that the chart isn't saving its own immage when the `update_chart()` function is called in `main.py`, I ended up taking out the `update_chart()` function and replaced it with an endpoint so that it can truelly be decoupled from the frontend and updated code wise while the backend is running with no corruption, plus the ema for the 15min live chart now finally works, now data collection for today is not good because of all the restarts and testing different code. Day 5, today was ment as a testing run for all the new UI changes the last 2 weeks, today was pretty good, no errors nothing out of the ordinary when looking at the logs and the charts, every chart seems to be working, Now i want implement zones into the live charts but ill do that when I have time.",

Day 4, Todays run was perfect, I still need to put the zones in the live chart and add the necessary logic to handle them, but I want to come up with better zone/15 minute previous days candle data storage extraction better than what were doing now, I'm thinking about doing sometype of local database or Parquet files, and retireving/querying them with DuckDB so reads are instant, simple and scalable. Day 5, today was alright, everything worked EMA wise but we had a websocket issue, im guessing the wifi went out, i asked GPT and it said there were 3 issues, DNS connectivity failure (primary), then Websocket keepalive timeout, then 2 code bugs making it worse (increment retry count without defining it in coroutine scope, we log that were switching providers but we log `active_provider` which never updates so its misleading), I think i fixed all of that but i won't know until next weeks run.",

No more parsing giant CSV/JSON—strategies can load last few sessions instantly and drill into history on demand. Wrote first pytest unit tests for candles, objects, and viewport queries, so the storage layer is verified and safe to extend. This lays the foundation for reliable sims, 100-day lookbacks, and future auto-backtests. Day 2, today was mainly about finishing the implementation of the new storage layer, we got most of it done, we have the candles downloaded as we planned, scalable and everything, its just firguring out how were going to replace the large 15m csv file we have as it kinda servers as a global index for the zones to work off of, now we need to figure that out for the objects (zones/levels) as well. Day 3, data collection was good, i think the parquet will be a good thing moving forward, but still trying to figure out how to store objects via the new storage system while still keeping track of there global index with the other candles and other objects.

Day 3, data collection good again, no issues, got the documentation done, just need to commit it since its on all the work computer, need to delete some files before I do that. Day 4, no errors on data collection, good again. Day 5, data collection was bad, didn't get anything, aparently computer auto-restarted and program didn't rerun, I need to run some manual function that auto handles getting the 15m candle sticks for today... that we missed out on. Luckily I made the mockup of a working function in less than an hour, but most likely will remove it in the future since the newer version of `objects.py` will be able to handle this automatically.",

Day 4, data collection was good, no issues, I was able to work on frontend today, finally got something showing, bunch of commits, today was a work from home day, luckily work allowed it hence why i was able to get so much done (in the other git branch) today.

Day 5, started bot a little late because of a calling-of-WS error I forgot about, fix was quick, this is a fruitful problem because this error in data collection should be a good test - live to see if the auto healer will work, healer did work with some error messages but will fix that even tho it worked through the error, will fix that on a later date, Data collection was alright then fix and is now good.",
