# Candle break could be interpreted in alot of different ways.
# Candle breaks above/below SOMETHING:
# Example:
# - Candle breaks above/below a specific EMA (sometimes there are candles that shoot through multiple so we will take that into account but that is rare)
# - Candle breaks above/below a object (support/resistance level/zone, flag/trendline, fib level, etc)
# - Candle breaks above/below previous candle high/low (bullish/bearish engulfing)
# - Candle breaks above/below a specific price level (psychological level, round number, etc)
