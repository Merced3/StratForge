Everything I'm focusing is:
Decoupling, I want to make this current system as simple, modular, easy to change, as possible.
So that if I do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] Fix healing error/warning message. *maybe, we will see with tomorrows run*
[x] work on Central option contract system.
    [x] get central hub working
    [-] get buying/selling working
        [ ] Setup quote Sim-Env. There will be times we need to test when market is not open.
        [ ] setup tests

Key: 
    [x] = done/working
    [-] = pending/developing currently
