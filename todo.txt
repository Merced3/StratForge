Everything I'm focusing is:
Decoupling, I want to make this current system as simple, modular, easy to change, as possible.
So that if I do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

Key:
    [x] = done/working
    [-] = pending/developing currently

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[-] start with 2 or 3 simple strategies: # See if we can handle multiple strategies
    [x] ema crossover
    [ ] candle ema break
    [ ] object break (zone/level)
[x] Fix EOD balance source-of-truth (start-of-day + P/L)
    [x] Capture start-of-day balance once per trading day (avoid overwriting on restarts)
    [x] Use trade ledger realized P/L for paper-mode EOD balance
    [ ] Add sanity logging: ledger P/L vs Discord totals
    [ ] Validate real-money EOD uses account balance and respects stored start-of-day
[-] Work on Analytics + Logging Branch
