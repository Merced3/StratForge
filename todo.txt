Currently working on everything display-wise

Everything the new storage system works, just need to get the display/frontend to read whats in the storage via the new stored procedures functionality. The unit tests will show everything storage working.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] frontend works enough, the objects display.
[x] Get the historical chart PNG file to show what we see on web_dash.
[ ] Get the EMA's to work with the live chart
[x] Auto heal doesn't work correctly, it gets the correct 15m data but it doesn't check if market was closed early and just returns from hard coded conventional market open times and closed times (8:30am to 3pm san antonio time)
[-] Make a script that audits ALL of 15m parquet day files. make sure it checks if there half days/full days or whatever, also that there are no gaps, 
[ ] change main functionality so that candles record correct timestamps, NY Session time, not relative.

Key: `x` = done/working, `-` = pending/developing currently

I can't test anything because most of my storage folder, I need to go home and tranfer a bunch of data Manually.
fill in cred.py as it was deleted and not tracked.
fill in storage folder alot of folders werent tracked.


When on main computer:
1) Make sure to upgrade the `kaleido`:
    `python -m pip install --upgrade "kaleido>=1.0.0"`
    THEN: `python -c "from web_dash.chart_updater import update_chart; update_chart(timeframe='15m', chart_type='zones', notify=False); print('zones png written')"`
    That should fix the 15min historical candle data image

2) run `tools/X` script that audits all the 15m candles to make sure the data is correct.
    It checks if the candle data is truely clean so we know every day after the fact is runnning
    based off the clean data from previous days. Then:
3) delete objects current and timeline folders. for clean slate for next thing.
4) run `python objects.py` to refill ALL objects based off verified cleaned data.
