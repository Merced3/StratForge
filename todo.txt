Everything I'm focusing is:
Decoupling, I want to make this current system as simple, modular, easy to change, as possible.
So that if i do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[ ] Extract `refresh_chart`:
    [ ] Extract it into a small “ui” helper and inject it into the pipeline (already halfway done with sinks).
[ ] Replace remaining globals with injected config or handles (e.g., feed/provider status).
[ ] Consolidate repeated session logic into `session.py` (already underway).

Key: `x` = done/working, `-` = pending/developing currently
