Everything I'm focusing is:
Decoupling, I want to make this current system as simple, modular, easy to change, as possible.
So that if I do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] Fix healing error/warning message. *maybe, we will see with tomorrows run*
[x] work on Central option contract system.
    [x] get central hub working
    [x] get buying/selling working
        [x] Setup quote Sim-Env. There will be times we need to test when market is not open.
        [x] setup tests
        [x] Build Position Order Watcher
[ ] wire position watcher into runtime/strategies OR Higher level Integration Tests.
[x] Discord folder, `integrations/dicsord/`, 
    [x] Make this decoupled from the whole system, easy to change/add too.
    [x] Goal MOVE `print_discord_messages.py` into that folder so the root NOW is clueless on what discord actually does.
    [x] `client.py` → thin wrappers for send/edit/file (can reuse `print_discord_messages.py` under the hood).
    [x] `templates.py` → all message formats in one place.
    [x] `__init__.py` makes imports predictable
        - if thats what we want to do. 
        - Where we can make this discord folder drag and 
        drop the `integrations/discord/` folder into other
        projects with only changing stuff in the `templates.py`
        file.
        - Thats not the "goal" but it keeps us to write good code.
    [x] `README.md` → usage + examples.

Key: 
    [x] = done/working
    [-] = pending/developing currently
