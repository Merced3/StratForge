Goal: maximize long-term expectancy with simple, testable rules.
Ethos: Keep systems decoupled, simple, easy-to-change, and modular. Changes should be isolated and safe to deploy while running so one failure does not cascade.
So that if I do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

Key:
    [x] = done
    [-] = in progress
    [ ] = todo

Main Setup (branch)
[-] start with 2 or 3 simple strategies: # See if we can handle multiple strategies
    [x] ema crossover
    [ ] candle ema break
    [ ] object break (zone/level)
[x] Fix EOD balance source-of-truth (start-of-day + P/L)
    [x] Capture start-of-day balance once per trading day (avoid overwriting on restarts)
    [x] Use trade ledger realized P/L for paper-mode EOD balance
    [ ] Add sanity logging: ledger P/L vs Discord totals
    [ ] Validate real-money EOD uses account balance and respects stored start-of-day
[-] Work on Analytics + Logging Branch
    [x] Analytics V1
    [-] Analytics V2

Analytics Setup (branch)
[-] Define success metrics and risk limits
    [ ] Target metrics: expectancy, win rate, avg win/loss, max drawdown, max losing streak, avg hold time
    [ ] Risk limits: none (exploration) but track daily drawdown + streaks
[-] Define data to record (minimal and useful)
    [ ] Keep trade ledger as source of truth
    [ ] Add per-trade position update log (mark price, unrealized pct, qty open)
    [ ] Do not record full option chains by default
[-] Cost model (use same assumptions in live + analytics)
    [ ] Commission per contract
    [ ] Slippage model (buy=ask, sell=bid or fixed ticks)
[x] Analytics v1 (ledger only)
    [x] Group by position_id
    [x] Compute realized P/L, win rate, avg win/loss, hold time, strategy_tag
[x] Strategy reporting (EOD)
    [x] Strategy report template
    [x] EOD sender (ledger-based)
    [x] Configure dedicated strategy-reporting channel (cred)
    [x] Confirm message IDs persist + edits (no flooding)
[-] Analytics v2 (path based, decoupled)
    [x] Research signal ledger (entry-only) at `storage\options\analytics\strategy_signals.jsonl`
    [x] Research signal runner wiring behind `RESEARCH_SIGNALS_ENABLED`
    [x] Path events: candle close + EMA/level/zone touches (deduped per candle)
    [x] Compute per-signal path metrics (MFE/MAE, time-to-MFE/MAE)
    [-] Simulate simple exits on recorded paths and rank rules
    [x] Add analytics reset tool for clean V1/V2 data wipes (backups + dry-run)
    [ ] Time-to-target and time-to-stop distributions

[-] Exit policy testing (offline only)
    [ ] Simulate 2-3 simple exit rules
    [ ] Walk-forward split (train/test) and keep the simplest rule that holds up
[-] Decision gate before changing live exits
    [ ] Require N trades (start at 100) and stable out-of-sample metrics

Current answers:
- Max daily loss/drawdown: none (exploration) - still track the numbers
- Minimum trades before changing exits: 100 (tentative)
- Trade frequency preference: open to all
- Hold past close: no (0DTE only for now)
