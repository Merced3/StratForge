Everything I'm focusing is:
Documentation focused, making sure that docs are aligned with what is currently going on before moving on to the next task which is the central hub of option contract pricing so that multiple trades and be monitored and handled at once.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] Update `docs/release-notes.md` to match reality: Tradier/Polygon failover is still active in `data_acquisition.py`; note the current provider setup or adjust code/docs for consistency.
[x] Refresh `docs/runbooks/rebuild-ema-state.md` to mirror `indicators/ema_manager.py`: JSON `ema_state`, premarket buffering, 09:45 ET finalize, merged pre/aftermarket CSVs, `USE_JSON_STATE`, and when to call `get_candle_data_and_merge`.
[x] Fix `docs/setup/project-structure.md` and `docs/TOC.md` to use the current `StratForge` name and `tests/…` layout (not `test/`); trim or add sections so the TOC reflects real files.
[x] Align `docs/testing/storage_tests.md` with actual tests under `tests/runtime` and `tests/storage_unit_tests` (e.g., `test_main_loop.py`, `test_process_data.py`, `test_wait_until_open.py`, `test_compaction.py`,`test_viewport.py`); remove or add entries for non-existent tests.
[-] Revisit `docs/roadmap.md`: update statuses/priorities (some items are stale) and clean wording.
[ ] Add a short data-acquisition note (new doc or in `docs/api/ws_server.md`): how `ws_auto_connect` switches Tradier/Polygon, session ID fetch, ping timeouts, and the Polygon market-status check.
[ ] Add a brief data note on markers: `storage/markers/<TF>.json` written by `add_markers()` for frontend/PNGs—schema and usage.
[ ] Document `storage/week_performances.json`: schema fields, how/when it’s updated, and how to consume it.
[ ] Optional: add stubs for the “coming soon” engine docs referenced in `overview.md` (`engine-overview`, `orders-and-tracking`) so links aren’t dangling.

Key: `x` = done/working, `-` = pending/developing currently
