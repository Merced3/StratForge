Branch focus: analytics setup for exit research (no live changes yet).
Goal: maximize long-term expectancy with controlled drawdown and simple, testable rules.
Ethos: Keep systems decoupled, simple, and modular. Changes should be isolated and safe to deploy while running so one failure does not cascade.

Key:
    [x] = done
    [-] = in progress
    [ ] = todo

Analytics Setup (branch)
[-] Define success metrics and risk limits
    [ ] Target metrics: expectancy, win rate, avg win/loss, max drawdown, max losing streak, avg hold time
    [ ] Risk limits: none (exploration) but track daily drawdown + streaks
[-] Define data to record (minimal and useful)
    [ ] Keep trade ledger as source of truth
    [ ] Add per-trade position update log (mark price, unrealized pct, qty open)
    [ ] Do not record full option chains by default
[-] Cost model (use same assumptions in live + analytics)
    [ ] Commission per contract
    [ ] Slippage model (buy=ask, sell=bid or fixed ticks)
[x] Analytics v1 (ledger only)
    [x] Group by position_id
    [x] Compute realized P/L, win rate, avg win/loss, hold time, strategy_tag
[-] Strategy reporting (EOD)
    [x] Strategy report template
    [x] EOD sender (ledger-based)
    [x] Configure dedicated strategy-reporting channel (cred)
    [ ] Confirm message IDs persist + edits (no flooding)
    [ ] Validate reporting on live data (100+ trades, per-strategy totals)
[-] Analytics v2 (path based)
    [ ] MFE/MAE per trade
    [ ] Time-to-target and time-to-stop distributions
[-] Exit policy testing (offline only)
    [ ] Simulate 2-3 simple exit rules
    [ ] Walk-forward split (train/test) and keep the simplest rule that holds up
[-] Decision gate before changing live exits
    [ ] Require N trades (start at 100) and stable out-of-sample metrics

Current answers:
- Max daily loss/drawdown: none (exploration) — still track the numbers
- Minimum trades before changing exits: 100 (tentative)
- Trade frequency preference: open to all
- Hold past close: no (0DTE only for now)
