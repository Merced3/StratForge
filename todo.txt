Everything I'm focusing is:
Now I want to focus on getting the WS reliably/simply working before the Central hub of option contract pricing so that multiple trades and be monitored and handled at once.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] Get WS and main seperate from deciding provider
[X] get the unit test proving WS is working.
[x] make sure every other unit test is working.

Key: `x` = done/working, `-` = pending/developing currently
