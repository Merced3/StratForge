Currently working on everything display-wise

Everything the new storage system works, just need to get the display/frontend to read whats in the storage via the new stored procedures functionality. The unit tests will show everything storage working.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] frontend works enough, the objects display.
[x] Get the historical chart PNG file to show what we see on web_dash.
[ ] Get the EMA's to work with the live chart
[x] Auto heal doesn't work correctly, it gets the correct 15m data but it doesn't check if market was closed early and just returns from hard coded conventional market open times and closed times (8:30am to 3pm san antonio time)
[x] Make a script that audits ALL of 15m parquet day files. make sure it checks if there half days/full days or whatever, also that there are no gaps and it can repiar the bad data.
[x] change main functionality so that candles record correct timestamps, NY Session time, not relative.
[x] make main.py compliant with dynamic open and close times.
[x] Clean up `main.py`, alot of places can be more centralized, avoid repeated calls, remove duplicated time checks and task churn, miscounts tasks, avoid unnecessary wake-ups, and reduce repitition in state resets.
    [x] Session utilities: Add helpers like `get_session_bounds(date)` (wraps `_nyse_session` + normalize) and `build_candle_schedule(open, close, timeframes, durations, buffer)` to centralize the timestamp/buffer generation and reuse for day-change recalcs.
    [x] Config hydration: Read `SYMBOL`, `TIMEFRAMES`, `CANDLE_BUFFER`, etc. once at startup and pass them into functions; avoid repeated `read_config(...)` calls in tight loops.
    [x] Process loop structure: In `main_loop(session_open, session_close)`, start `process_data(...)` once and await it; drop the outer `while datetime.now(...) <= market_close_time` guard (let `process_data` stop at close). This removes duplicated time checks and task creation churn.
    [x] Queue handling: Move `queue.task_done()` inside the message-processing block so each consumed message is accounted for; right now it runs only once after the loop, which can miscount tasks if you ever `join()` the queue.
    [x] Wait logic: Replace the busy loop in `wait_until_market_open` with a single `asyncio.sleep` to the computed delta (clamped at zero) to avoid unnecessary wake-ups.
    [x] State resets: Extract a `reset_day_state()` that resets `current_candles`, `candle_counts`, and `start_times` in one place (initial setup + day rollover) to reduce repetition.
[x] make unit tests proving the "new" - more efficent `main.py` should work. `runtime/`

Key: `x` = done/working, `-` = pending/developing currently

I can't test anything because most of my storage folder, I need to go home and tranfer a bunch of data Manually.
fill in cred.py as it was deleted and not tracked.
fill in storage folder alot of folders werent tracked.

When on main machine:
1) Run `python tools/audit_candles.py --timeframes 15m --verbose` to audit all candles (missing days, gaps/extras, early closes).
2) Run `python tools/repair_candles.py --timeframe 15m --max-age-days 1825` to repair what the audit found (flip clean_files_active=True when ready).
    optional: you could re-run the audit, just to double check.
3) Delete storage/objects/current and storage/objects/timeline for a clean slate.
4) Run `python objects.py` to rebuild all objects from the verified, cleaned data.
