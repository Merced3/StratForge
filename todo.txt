Everything I'm focusing is:
Decoupling, I want to make this current system as simple, modular, easy to change, as possible.
So that if i do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[ ] Docs:
    [ ] `docs/adr/0003-decouple-data-pipeline-from-orchestrator.md`
    [ ] `docs/architecture/engine-overview.md` runtime services + restartability matrix
    [ ] `docs/runbooks/data-pipeline.md`
    [ ] `docs/runbooks/release-guardrails.md`
[ ] Implementation:
    [ ] Phase 1: extract `process_data` to `data_pipeline.py` with injected sinks
    [ ] Phase 2: data_acquisition.start_feed/stop_feed
    [ ] Phase 3: slim main.py orchestrator
    [ ] Phase 4 (optional): decouple indicator/strategy workers and add replay path
    
Key: `x` = done/working, `-` = pending/developing currently
