Everything I'm focusing is:
Decoupling, I want to make this current system as simple, modular, easy to change, as possible.
So that if i do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] Extract `refresh_chart`:
    [x] Extract it into a small “ui” helper and inject it into the pipeline (already halfway done with sinks).
    [x] Make sure all docs reflect this change.
[x] Replace remaining globals with injected config or handles (e.g., feed/provider status).
    [x] work on globals in `main.py`
    [x] global providers on `data_acquisition.py` needs to be removed.
    [x] update/run test. Passed
    [x] Update docs to be in alignment, then commit. No docs needed.
[x] Consolidate repeated session logic into `session.py` (already underway).
    [x] centralize the `NY_TZ` into the sessions script, its better fit. 
Key: 
    `x` = done/working
    `-` = pending/developing currently
