Everything I'm focusing is:
Decoupling, I want to make this current system as simple, modular, easy to change, as possible.
So that if I do want to make changes and update those changes, as its running - to other system's the other systems don't fail.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] Fix healing error/warning message. *maybe, we will see with tomorrows run*
[-] work on Central option contract system.

Key: 
    [x] = done/working
    [-] = pending/developing currently
